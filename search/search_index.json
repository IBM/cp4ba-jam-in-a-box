They are available on this public GitHub and, therefore, can be used by customers, business partners, and IBMers.</p> <p>The rapid deployment scripts are available for some selected CP4BA versions.</p> <p>As part of this Lab, you will only deploy DB2 and CP4BA. All other required preparation steps (OpenShift, LDAP, storage, preparation of bastion host, ...) were already completed on the provided environment, so you can concentrate on the essential part: Configure and Install IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation version 23.0.2 on Red Hat OpenShift.</p> <p>We have created a TechZone environment preconfigured with a bastion host and a three-worker node Red Hat OpenShift cluster. In addition, IBM Security Directory Server (SDS) was installed and configured on the bastion host required by CP4BA. To fit the size of the OpenShift cluster, it is recommended to use our FoundationContent template for use by the rapid deployment scripts. This template will install foundational services required by CP4BA and Filenet Content Manager components.</p> <p>Using other templates that would deploy more CP4BA components is very similar, but would require more system resources for building such a larger deployment, that are not available on the provided TechZone environment.</p> <p>During the first exercise, you will reserve an environment on TechZone, access it, and verify that your RedHat OpenShift cluster is working correctly.</p> <p>The following exercises will guide you through configuring and installing DB2 containerized and CP4BA version 23.0.2 IF002 on OCP using the rapid deployment scripts.</p> <p>Complete this Lab to be able to earn a badge.</p>"},{"location":"23.0.2/Bring-up/Bring-Up-Lab-1/#notation","title":"Notation","text":"<p>Paragraphs formatted like the below contain excerpts from configuration files, or commands to enter in a Terminal window.

Congratulations. Exiting...\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>While the script is running, you optionally can review the changes applied:</li> </ol> <p>a. First, the IBM DB2 Operator Catalog is deployed, see   db2OperatorCatalog.yaml   in folder   cp4ba-rapid-deployment/cp4ba-23-0-2/mycluster/deployment-db2-cp4ba   . An operator catalog gives you access to a set of operators, for example the D2 operator.</p> <p>b. A new project in OCP is created using a by the 02 script generated file named   db2-namespace.yaml   . This file gets generated from template file   db2-namespace.template.yaml   by injecting some of the parameters from   01-parametersForDb2OnOCP.sh   , for example parameter   db2OnOcpProjectName   that is set to value   ibm-db2   .</p> <p>c. A new secret is created in the new project using your Entitlement Registry key named   ibm-registry   .</p> <pre><code>  Note: A dummy email is used by the scripts.\n</code></pre> <p>d. The OpenShift Global Pull Secret is modified to ensure you can pull the container images for DB2.</p> <p>e. An Operator Group object for DB2 Operator is created. The 02 script generated a file named   db2-operatorgroup.yaml   . This file gets generated from template file   db2-operatorgroup.template.yaml   by injecting some of the parameters from   01-parametersForDb2OnOCP.sh   .</p> <p>f. A Subscription for the DB2 Operator is created. The 02 script generated a file named   db2-subscription.yaml   . This file gets generated from template file   db2-subscription.template.yaml   by injecting some of the parameters from   01-parametersForDb2OnOCP.sh   . For example, the namespace (project name), channel and startingCSV are set.</p> <pre><code>  Applying this Subscription causes the DB2 operator to install. As you can see in the definition, installPlanApproval is set to Manual. This is to avoid DB2 operator to automatically update to latest version as this can cause issues while the DB2 instance deployment. Therefore, the script has to approve the first DB2 Operator install plan to allow the version provided under startingCSV to install. Install plans generated afterwards should not get approved by you manually to avoid issues while the creation of the DB2 instance.\n</code></pre> <p>g. Once the DB2 Operator is installed, the script is deploying the Db2u cluster. For this, the 02 script generated a file named   db2.yaml   . This file gets generated from template file   db2.template.yaml   by injecting some of the parameters from   01-parametersForDb2OnOCP.sh   . For example, the namespace, license, admin user password and instance version are set.</p> <pre><code>  Applying this resource causes the Db2u cluster to be installed using the specified parameters.\n\n  Between the applied files there are multiple dependencies, for example between DB2 Operator version installed (startingCSV) and Db2u cluster version installed. For example, newer DB2 Operators will not install older Db2u cluster versions and vice versa. Due to the rapid deployment scripts and the set of default values provided by them, beginners don\u2019t need to care about such dependencies. Advanced users could modify these properties as well to deploy newer DB2 versions, for example also on a newer OpenShift version. But, in some cases changing the parameters in   01-parametersForDb2OnOCP.sh   is not sufficient, further changes in the .template. files will most likely be needed, too.\n</code></pre> <p>h. Once the Db2u cluster is up and running, the 02 script waits till the job   c-db2ucluster-restore-morph   completes, which is the last step in deploying the cluster. Then, the script does also apply some further configuration changes to the Db2u cluster, performs a full re-start of DB2 and drops the default database BLUDB as this one is not needed for your CP4BA deployment. Last but not least some useful information is provided in case you want to connect to this DB2 cluster with for example IBM Data Studio.</p> <ol> <li>Once the script completed, review the script output and ensure there are no errors, and that it is completed as shown in the sample script output.</li> </ol> <p>If you you have hit an issue and you don't know how to resolve it, please reach out to your hosting staff.</p> <ol> <li>Look at the output of your script and verify that the deletion of BLUDB was successful.

The Starter type deployment is useful for demonstrations, and includes the deployment of most prerequisites such as LDAP Server and databases. Tn this Lab guide however the Production deployment type is used instead, which can also be used for demonstrations, but also for deployments, which are used in production environments of customers. The procedure is described in the knowledge center in the \"Installing Production Deployments\" section, available from https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/23.0.2?topic=installing-production-deployments.</p> <p>In Production deployments, separate installations of the databases and an LDAP server are needed. The LDAP server has been pre-installed in the lab environment used for this exercise, and the installation of the databases has been completed in previous exercises.</p> <p>For the installation, the case package is used, which is available for download in Github. The case package is maintained by the IBM Product Development teams, and for every new ifix an updated script package is available. The links to the case packages can be found on the \"Cloud Pak for Business Automation Interim fix download document\", which is available from https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6576423.</p> <p>For the successful deployment of Cloud Pak for Business Automation, apart from Database and LDAP Server, storage volumes to store the persistent storage requests need to be created. While the required storage volumes can be created manually, if needed, in this Lab a Storage Class will be used, a suitable one has also been provided with the Lab environment, this is checked in one of the steps below.</p> <p>For the main deployment of the CP4BA Operator, the documentation lists different possible solutions in the section \"Setting up the cluster\", available at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/23.0.2?topic=deployment-setting-up-cluster. In this lab, the approach to \"Setting up the cluster by running a script\" is used, which performs the required steps for creating the project, setting up the operator user account, deploying the cert manager and license manager, creating the secret for accessing the container library and finally setting up the CP4BA Operators. Those steps can be done separately too, in case a customer requires it. The alternative would be a more graphical deployment through forms done on the OCP Administration GUI.</p> <p>The exercise instructions in the following paragraph will guide you through the download and unpacking of the case package. Scripts available in the case package are then used to deploy the Cloud Pak for Business Automation operators, the Licensing Operator and the Certificate Manager Operator into the Openshift cluster.

The Starter type deployment is useful for demonstrations, and includes the deployment of most prerequisites such as LDAP Server, Users and databases. Tn this Lab guide however the Production deployment type is used instead, which can also be used for demonstrations, but is primarily meant for deployments, which are used in development, test and production environments of customers. Further restrictions of the Starter type of deployment are that Air-Gapped installations are not supported, and not all CP4BA components can be used in this mode. The procedure for a Production type of deployment is described in the knowledge center in the \"Installing Production Deployments\" section, available from https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/24.0.0?topic=installing-production-deployments.</p> <p>In Production deployments, separate installations of the databases and an LDAP server are needed, but since Version 24.0.0 the EDB Postgres Operator can automatically be invoked to create the required databases. However, the installation of the databases can also be done separately which will be covered in a later exercise in the lab environment used for the Bring-Up-Lab. The LDAP server has been pre-installed, along with definitions of users and groups.</p> <p>For the installation, the case package is only needed, if deployment should be done from the commandline, and the Kubernetes / Openshift environment to deploy into is air-gapped. It is available for download in Github. The case package is maintained by the IBM Product Development teams, and contains a list of images, which might be needed during deployment of CP4BA, and is required to setup a custom docker repository for the deployment of air-gapped environments. Since Version 24.0.0, the scripts package is separately available in the cert-kubernetes repositoy. The links to the case packages can be found on the \"Cloud Pak for Business Automation Interim fix download document\", which is available from https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6576423. </p> <p>For the successful deployment of Cloud Pak for Business Automation, apart from Database and LDAP Server, File Systems to store configuration, logfiles, possibly also documents or fulltext search indexes are needed.  Openshift maintains those filesystems through Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume claims, which could, at least for the Cloud Pak for Business Automation components, be created manually to fulfil special requirements. One example usecase for this is the creation of persistent volumes of type <code>hostpath</code>, to be able to mount more than one filesystem, in case a customer using a large number of FileNet File Stoage Areas wants to migrate to Containers. For persistent volumes which are not pre-allocated, a Storage Class can be used to automatically create Persistent Volumes for any volume claims created during the deployment. A suitable Storage Class has also been provided with the Lab environment, this is checked in one of the steps below.</p> <p>For the main deployment of the CP4BA Operator, the documentation lists different possible solutions in the section \"Setting up the cluster\", available at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/24.0.0?topic=deployment-setting-up-cluster. In this lab, the approach to \"Setting up the cluster by running a script\" is used, which performs the required steps for creating the project, setting up the operator user account, deploying the cert manager and license manager, creating the secret for accessing the container library and finally setting up the CP4BA Operators. Those steps can be done separately too, in case a customer requires it. The alternative would be a more graphical deployment through forms which need to be filled out on the OCP Administration GUI.</p> <p>Note about Air-Gap deployments: This refers to the installation of Cloud Pak 4 Business Automation in environments, which have no access to \"the internet\", and thus cannot use the IBM Container Library and other Container registries directly for deployment. Since Version 23.0.2,  CP4BA now supports version 3.0 of the Air-Gap, through deployment of an addon to the Openshift commandline program \"oc\".</p> <p>In Air-Gap deployments, usually a local registry is used, and images from the IBM Container library are copied into that local registry. Furthermore, Openshift is configured by using an Image Content Source Policy, to request openshift to search the local registry whenever specific images (specified through their SHA256) are referenced from the IBM Container library.</p> <p>When copying the images to the local registry and setup of the Image Content Source Policy have completed successfully, deployment of an Air-Gapped environment can be done mostly like a regular, non air-gapped one.</p> <p>The exercise instructions in the following paragraphs will guide you through the download and unpacking of the case package. Scripts available in the cert-kubernetes repository are then used to deploy the Cloud Pak 4 Business Automation operators, the Licensing Operator and the Certificate Manager Operator into the Openshift cluster. Correct installation is reviewed in the following section called \"Verification instructions\".</p>"},{"location":"24.0.0/Bring-Up/Bring-Up-Lab-2/Exercise-2-Deploy-Operator/#22-exercise-instructions","title":"2.2 Exercise Instructions","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Click on the tile for the Bastion host.

In the last exercise it was shown how to obtain the value. The cluster has only one storage class named nfs-client. Provide that storage class on all four questions.</p> <p></p> <p>The names of the storage classes are not checked at this point. Checking is done towards the end when invoking the <code>cp4a-prerequisites.sh</code> in validate mode. This allows to create the storage classes as part of the prerequisite installation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next question is on the deployment size. The CP4BA deployment supports different deployment sizes, <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code> and <code>large</code>. Selecting a size will influence default sizes for most of the components of the Cloud Pak 4 Business Automation environment, influencing the number of pod replicas, as well as assigned memory and cpu for the pods. Those are only default values, though, which can be overridden, if needed, through definitions in the custom resource.

Since Version CP4BA Version 24.0.0, the Postgres EDB Operator, which is included in the Cloud Pak For Business Automation, and used for the deployment for example of the Zen Component, can also be used for automatic creation of the database pod, and the databases, similar as it is done for the Starter mode. In this Bring Up Lab however, we will manually setup the database and create and run the database creation scripts, so select 4 for \"PostgreSQL\".</p> </li> <li> <p>The deployment scripts supports usage of multiple different database servers on a deployment. To differentiate between them, alias names need to be provided. This deployment will use only 1, so select db1 as the alias name(s).</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Supply the name of the Openshift Project / Namespace to deploy into, the value is ibm-cp4ba</p> </li> <li> <p>Outbound communication of the CP4BA components is needed, to access custom databases and other resources. It can even be important for the display of documents, if the environments hosts HTML Pages, which reference graphics from external resources, for example. As uncontrolled access to the internet can expose the environment to risks, it is a good idea to restrict outbound communication. This will have the CP4BA Operators create Openshift Network Policies to restrict the traffic. The general recommendation for the setting would be to restrict outbound communication, and then define some custom network policies to allow access to the needed resources. For this sample environment, we will not restrict outbound communication though, so select \"No\". </p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Also since Version 24.0.0, the IM Metastore Db, Zen Metastore Db and BTS metastore DB can be stored on an external PostgreSQL Databases. Select \"No\" on the three questions to have them installed using databases created automatically through the PostgreSQL EDB Operator, as with earlier releases of CP4BA.</p> </li> <li> <p>Also since Version 24.0.0, external certificates can be used for the Opensearch and the Kafka deployments. Select No on this question to have the CP4BA operator provisioning them.</p> </li> <li> <p>On the question how many object stores to deploy, select 2.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This concludes the information gathering, and a result page is printed in the Terminal window. </p>"},{"location":"24.0.0/Bring-Up/Bring-Up-Lab-2/Exercise-3-Prepare-Deployment/#33-verification","title":"3.3 Verification","text":"<p>The script should have created a directory with property files, for further configuration. </p> <p>List the files in the generated directory:</p> <pre><code>ls -ltR cp4ba-prerequisites\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>These configuration files need to be filled with values.

Abort when you see its running.</p> <pre><code>oc get pods -l app=postgres -w\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>To allow running commands in the Postgres Pod without looking up its name every time, it is recommended to set a shell variable.     <pre><code>POSTGRES=$(oc get pods -l app=postgres -o 'jsonpath={.items[0].metadata.name}'); echo \"Postgres Pod is $POSTGRES\"\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>The postgres Pod contains a single filesystem, which will be used for all of the tablespacs needed for the databases, and which still need to be created. Lets verify that postgres is now available and has no tablespaces defined yet. The required command is:     <pre><code>oc exec $POSTGRES -- psql -U pgadmin -c '\\db+'\n</code></pre>     Following output is expected:     <pre><code>                                    List of tablespaces\n    Name    |  Owner  | Location | Access privileges | Options |  Size  | Description \n------------+---------+----------+-------------------+---------+--------+-------------\n pg_default | pgadmin |          |                   |         | 29 MB  | \n pg_global  | pgadmin |          |                   |         | 531 kB | \n(2 rows)\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Some of the postgres parameters need further customization, so copy out the parameters file for modification.

Remove the # character in front of the the line, and change the value to support 1000 prepared transactions.

The settings make the ssl certificate known to Postgres. Insert the following line after the block with the ssl settings, as shown in the picture:</p> <p></p> <p>Insert the following lines: <pre><code>ssl = on\nssl_cert_file = '/var/lib/postgresql/data/server.crt'\nssl_key_file = '/var/lib/postgresql/data/server.key'\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Save the file and close the editor.</p> </li> <li> <p>Copy back the configuration file into the container. The directory containing it is backed up by a persistent volume, so any changes on it will persist.

It can be seen that the default port for PostgreSQL is 5432. For the query we can also use the label which is used for the deployment, as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>The commands to determine this information are:</p> <pre><code>oc get service -l app=postgres\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>That service is made available through the DNS of Kubernetes, with the name ..svc. Pods within the same project/namespace can also use only the servicename. Lets check it by opening a shell in the operator pod, and test connectivity.  <p> </p> <p>Of course the curl command cannot terminate, as PostgreSQL is not telnet, so abort it by pressing Ctrl-C. But the verbose output allows checking, if the connection can be made. Within Containers, connectivity cannot be checked with the usual ping command. The required commands are:</p> <pre><code>oc get pod -l name=ibm-cp4a-operator\noc exec &lt;name of ibm-cp4a-operator pod&gt; -it -- bash\ncurl -v telnet://postgres.ibm-cp4ba.svc:5432\n</code></pre> <p>You can close the shell in the Operator pod again.</p> <li> <p>The next step is to update the property files, which have been generated previously, with the information from the Postgres database deployment. Navigate back to the directory containing them, and edit the files.</p> <pre><code>cd $HOME/cp4ba/cert-kubernetes/scripts/cp4ba-prerequisites/propertyfile\ngedit cp4ba_db_server.property\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>It is suggested to make the window wide enough to not be disturbed by the comments. Modify the server name, port, ssl, and client ssl settings in this file as indicated below.</p> <p></p> <p>Hint: The name of the server had been used in one of the previous steps. You can copy it from there.</p> </li> <li> <p>For the PostgreSQL communication, we have enabled SSL, but disabled SSL_CLIENT_SERVER parameters. The comments in the parameters file describe, which further information is needed. Read that section carefully. Then save the file, and close the editor. </p> </li> <li> <p>The required certificate can be copied out of the directory where it was created, out of the Postgres pod, or out of the secret. The below command copies it out of the secret.</p> <pre><code>oc get secret postgres-tls -o 'jsonpath={.data.tls\\.crt}' | base64 --decode &gt; cert/db/db1/db-cert.crt\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Then invoke the editor again on the other database related property file. Before invoking the editor, just determine how the database password passw0rd looks like, when its base64 encoded, that string is required when editing the next file.</p> <pre><code>echo -n passw0rd | base64\ngedit cp4ba_db_name_user.property\n</code></pre> <p>Note: The -n option to echo will suppress the linefeed character, which echo normally prints following the output. If it is included, the linefeed will be part of the base64 encoded string, and might lead to illegal passwords, which are very hard to find later.</p> </li> <li> <p>First step for editing the document is to replace all passwords. You can invoke the search and replace function through the hamburger menu on top right corner (next to the Save button). You can copy and paste both values from the editor, and from the Terminal window. The password needs to be replaced 4 times, for the four databases.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>The next step is to replace the database user name. We will use one user account for all databases, so replace  with cp4badbuser as indicated in the screenshot, 4 times.  <p></p> <li> <p>Review the file, and check, if any further field need to be updated in the file, that should not be the case.

The following command does this. The command in the first line finds and loops over the sql files in the subfolders. For each of the files found, the next three commands are executed.

Locate any sections above and provide a value. The required value for the <code>oc_cpe_obj_store_admin_user_groups</code> field is <code>cp4badmins</code>, it case it occurs.</p> <p>Note that the deployment scripts have chosen a specification for the \"Content\" Custom Resource Definition, which is being worked by the Content Operator. So any error messages will be logged by the Content Operator. Other deployments of the Cloud Pak for Business Automation, which also include other patterns, such as Business Automation Workflow would require a different kind of specification, using the \"ICP4ACluster\" Custom Resource Definition, which would be worked by the CP4A Operator.</p> <p>Also, the \"CR\", the \"Custom Resource\" as it is called, is not always named \"icp4acluster\". This one has the default name \"content\", which you are free to change if needed. That name will be used in many derived names though, including some of the secret names, so better don\u2019t change it for the moment.</p> <p>For editing Custom Resources, or more general YAML files, it is good to use an editor supporting the special requirements of YAML files, and also supporting syntax highlighting.
