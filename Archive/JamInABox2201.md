# Jam-in-a-Box for Business Automation (for CP4BA 22.0.1)

## Introduction

Use the Jam-in-a-Box environments to demo the out-of-box end-to-end [Client Onboarding solution](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-client-onboarding-scenario), run your own mini-Tech Jam, or get self-educated on Business Automation.

Jam-in-a-Box removes hurdles to Business Automation adoption through easing availability and sharing of technical enablement. Towards this it offers a set of self-provisionable environments hosted on IBM TechZone, combined with a set of [hands-on technical labs](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-labs/tree/main/22.0.1) spanning all capabilities of Business Automation.

## Use cases for Jam-in-a-Box

### 1. Technical Enablement

1. Self-enablement - use the environment to gain hands-on experience on one or all capabilities of Business Automation using a realistic business scenario
2. Client-enablement - use the environment to host a mini-Tech-Jam for your clients

### 2. Demo/PoX

1. Demo - use out-of-box Client Onboarding to present a live demo of Business Automation capabilities
2. PoX - use the environments as a base to customize/extend the business scenario based on your clientâ€™s needs
